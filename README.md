## 📖 Introduction

Test automation is the process of using software tools to execute tests, validate outcomes, and create reports automatically. This project focuses on automating the testing of Swag Labs, also known as Sauce Demo (https://www.saucedemo.com), using TestNG for data-driven testing (DDT) with Selenium. Automation increases testing efficiency, accuracy, and repeatability, minimizing manual effort and reducing costs.

## 📌 Scope

This project covers the following Swag Labs areas:

- **Login Page**: Tests for all valid user scenarios and error handling.
- **Product Page**: Covers sorting features and detailed product views.
- **Cart Page**: Tests functionalities related to the shopping cart for valid users.

## 🌟 Features

- **Data-Driven Testing with Cucumber**: Automates testing with DDT using Gherkin syntax for clear, readable test cases.
- **Selenium Automation**: Automates interactions with web elements.
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Includes over 100 test cases for login, product features, cart functions, and more.
- **Detailed Bug Reports**: Provides bug reports and clear test outcomes.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies Used

This project combines various tools and technologies to ensure effective and efficient testing:

- **Java**: Primary language for writing test automation code.
- **Selenium**: Automates browser interactions for web testing.
- **ChromeDriver**: WebDriver implementation for Chrome, enabling Selenium automation.
- **TestNG**: Manages and runs Java test cases.
- **Maven**: Manages project dependencies and builds.
- **Eclipse IDE**: Provides a workspace for coding, testing, and debugging.

These tools form a powerful framework for automating test cases, validating outcomes, and generating reports.
